The purpose of this text document is to act as a starting point.

Engine - This isn't a great term to use, but there will be a kind of framework
in place to manage resources (memory, input devices, things like that)

Editor - Windows-only, this will be for blocking out the level geometry and
importing assets for levels

Scripting - If any scripting occurs, it will be a simple custom scripting
language

The point - I guess I want to do something for the Xbox, so I'm doing this.
The Windows build is not really for me but for others to see.

Debugging tools - Simple RPC for issuing debugging commands and in-game
visualisations for memory usage, performance, etc.

Artificial intelligence - AI will be very simple, no complicated tactical,
strategic thinking

Physics - Simple physics; rag dolls and moveable crates
